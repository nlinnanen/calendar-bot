# Calendar Bot ðŸ“…

A Telegram bot that generates a link to a calendar event from a message. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to parse the title and time of the meeting and generate the link. The usecase is when a meeting is scheduled in a chat, with a message "Meeting at 3pm tomorrow", the message can be forwarded to the bot. The bot will then generate a link to a calendar event with the title "Meeting" and the time "3pm tomorrow".

The bot is currently hosted on Fly and can be found with the nickname [@KalenteriLinkBot](https://t.me/kalenterilinkbot).

## Usage

Send the bot a message with the title and time of the event. The bot will then generate a link to a calendar event with the title and time.
